If you lack a translation you may find it at http://www.algodoo.com/translations/. You can also create your own translations and upload them there.

HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN TRANSLATION:
	Start by copying English.cfg into either this directory, or better, into My Documents/Algodoo/data/language/ and then rename it YourLanguage.cfg.
	It should now show up in Algodoo under File->Change language.
	
	Edit the file to translate. To update the translation in Algodoo, switch to English and then back to your language again.
	Any errors will be shown in the console, which you can access by pressing F11 in Algodoo.

	Once you are done, share your translation at the URL above!
