	Check the Algodoo console for syntax errors in the translation. The console can be accessed via the button below Esc and above Tab.

	Any translation ending with _Tooltip is a special message shown when the mouse hovers over a button or slider etc.
	On touch screens, this message is shown when the user press-and-holds on a button.
	
	Some things have a special text for touch-only devices (like tablets). These ends with _Touch. For instance:

	ToolDrag                = "Drag";
	ToolDrag_Tooltip        = "Drag tool (D) - drags objects when the simulation is running.";
	ToolDrag_Tooltip_Touch  = "Drag tool - drags objects when the simulation is running.";
