From Claude:
Collision    -> Contact
Help         -> "Help me!"
Play/Pause   -> Split. "Play" / "Pause"
Other things read "Pull this button for ... "  instead of
"Pan the viewpoint" for instance.
The "rewind" button reads "Undo sim start", but it's really
a "Researt button" and should have the icon

The «move» and «drag» tools should be represented with a
hand icon as they are on most software.  The drag tool threw
me off many time, and I did not understand why «drag» was
different than «move»  in functionality.
